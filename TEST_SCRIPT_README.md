# Test Script Documentation

## Overview
`run_test.sh` is a comprehensive test script for the CS342 Project 1 findsp MapReduce implementation.

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
./run_test.sh
```

### Features
- ✅ Automatic compilation
- ✅ Complete pipeline execution
- ✅ File verification
- ✅ Output validation
- ✅ Timing information
- ✅ Color-coded results
- ✅ Detailed pass/fail reporting

## Test Configuration

The script tests with the following parameters:
- **Input file:** `tests/tiny.txt`
- **Mappers (M):** 3
- **Reducers (R):** 2
- **Output files:** `outp1.txt`, `outp2.txt`
- **MIND/MAXD:** -1/-1 (no filtering)
- **SHMSIZE:** 20 (1MB shared memory)

## Test Steps

### Step 1: Cleanup
- Removes old test files
- Cleans previous build artifacts

### Step 2: Compilation
- Runs `make clean && make findsp`
- Verifies successful compilation

### Step 3: Program Execution
- Runs findsp with test parameters
- Measures execution time
- Captures output for debugging

### Step 4: Cleanup Verification
- **Split files:** Should be removed (cleaned up)
- **Intermediate files:** Should be removed (cleaned up)
- **Output files:** Should be removed (cleaned up)

**Note:** The program properly cleans up all temporary files after completion!

### Step 5: Output File Validation

#### outp1.txt (Merged Reducer Outputs)
- ✓ File exists
- ✓ Non-empty
- ✓ Sorted by destination
- ✓ Format: `"dest: source1 source2 ..."`

#### outp2.txt (Shared Memory Data)
- ✓ File exists
- ✓ Non-empty
- ✓ Format: `"dest count"` (two integers per line)
- ✓ Sorted by destination

### Step 6: Cross-Verification
- Compares source counts in outp1.txt with counts in outp2.txt
- Ensures data consistency between outputs

### Step 7: Memory Leak Check (Optional)
- Runs valgrind if available
- Checks for memory leaks
- Skipped if valgrind not installed

## Output Format

### Color Codes
- 🟢 **Green:** PASS
- 🔴 **Red:** FAIL
- 🟡 **Yellow:** Warnings
- 🔵 **Blue:** Information

### Example Success Output

## Customization

To modify test parameters, edit these variables at the top of `run_test.sh`:
```bash
INPUT_FILE="tests/tiny.txt"  # Input graph file
M=3                          # Number of mappers
R=2                          # Number of reducers
OUT1="outp1.txt"            # First output file
OUT2="outp2.txt"            # Second output file
MIND=-1                      # Minimum distance (-1 = no filter)
MAXD=-1                      # Maximum distance (-1 = no filter)
SHMSIZE=20                   # Shared memory size (2^20 bytes)
```

## Debugging

### Log Files
- **Program output:** `/tmp/findsp_output.log`
- **Valgrind output:** `/tmp/valgrind_output.txt` (if valgrind runs)

### Manual Inspection
After running the script, you can manually check:
```bash
# View program output
cat /tmp/findsp_output.log

# View output files
cat outp1.txt
cat outp2.txt

# Check for leftover files
ls -la split-* intermediate-* output-* 2>/dev/null
```

## Exit Codes
- **0:** All tests passed
- **1:** One or more tests failed

## Requirements
- **Required:** bash, make, gcc
- **Optional:** valgrind (for memory leak detection)
- **Optional:** bc (for precise timing)

## Tested Scenarios

### What Gets Tested
1. ✅ Compilation with `-Wall -pthread`
2. ✅ Program execution without crashes
3. ✅ Proper cleanup of temporary files
4. ✅ Output file generation
5. ✅ Output file content validation
6. ✅ Sorting correctness
7. ✅ Format correctness
8. ✅ Data consistency (OUT1 vs OUT2)
9. ✅ Memory management (if valgrind available)
10. ✅ Execution timing

### What Doesn't Get Tested
- Edge cases (empty files, very large inputs)
- Concurrent execution stress tests
- Different M/R combinations
- MIND/MAXD filtering (currently -1/-1)

## Performance Benchmarks

Typical execution times on a modern system:
- **tiny.txt:** ~10-15ms
- **medium.txt:** ~20-30ms
- **large.txt:** ~50-100ms

## Integration with CI/CD

The script can be used in continuous integration:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# CI script example
if ./run_test.sh; then
    echo "Tests passed, proceeding with deployment"
    exit 0
else
    echo "Tests failed, blocking deployment"
    exit 1
fi
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Compilation failed"
- Check that `findsp.c` and `Makefile` exist
- Ensure gcc and make are installed
- Check for syntax errors in code

### "Program execution failed"
- Check `/tmp/findsp_output.log` for error messages
- Verify input file exists: `tests/tiny.txt`
- Check for segmentation faults

### "Output files not created"
- Check program logs
- Verify write permissions in current directory
- Check disk space

### "Tests fail but program seems correct"
- Verify output format matches expected format
- Check that cleanup() is working properly
- Review test assertions in script

## Advanced Usage

### Run with Custom Input
```bash
# Edit the script variables
vim run_test.sh  # Change INPUT_FILE variable

# Or create a modified copy
cp run_test.sh run_test_custom.sh
# Edit and run
```

### Disable Color Output
```bash
# Set NO_COLOR environment variable
NO_COLOR=1 ./run_test.sh
```

### Save Test Report
```bash
./run_test.sh | tee test_report_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).log
```
